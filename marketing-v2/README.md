# Landgriffon Marketing v2

Project integrated into the Horizon 2020 EU Research and Innovation Programme. The goal of this grant is to design, develop, and validate tools that facilitate a more sustainable supply chain management. How? By identifying where food supply chain raw materials are produced, and analyze its environmental impacts, anticipate future risks and facilitate a well-informed decision-making process. The tools will be designed, developed and validated through a process of business cases, in which we will ask some companies to participate in the definition and test. The final outcome of the project is an MVP validated by some of the companies that will take part in business cases. This project is initially organised in 6 work packages: WP1 Management; WP2 Market & Business; WP3 Products & Services ; WP4 Customer Business Cases; WP5 User Portal and Service Portal; WP6 Dissemination & Communication.
