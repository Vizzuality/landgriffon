This deforestation due to commodity-driven agriculture can be direct or indirect. Direct  impact would be land use change in order to create new arable land (i.e. cutting trees for pasture) whereas indirect would be deforestation to create new roads to accommodate better supply and transport.

In the methodology used for computing this indicator we are assuming just direct deforestation due to the change of forest to an especific commodity.",4e8ff3aa-8980-44cb-97d4-bdb74612f078,"{   ""name"": ""Deforestation due to land use change"",   ""resolution"": ""30m x 30m"",   ""geographic coverage"": ""Global coverage"",   ""source"": ""Hansen, M.

Particularly forest, through growth of trees and the increase of soil carbon, contain a large part of the carbon stored on land.

Activities such us land use change or deforestation may affect carbon storage producing a disturbance of the carbon pools that may be released into the atmosphere.

Carbon emissions due to land use change would therefore be the realease of carbon into the atmosphere driven by the change from forest into a specific aggriculture commodity.",5daec381-8fc6-43b8-91f2-c54dc796ac85,"{   ""name"": ""Carbon emissions due to land use change"",   ""resolution"": ""30m x 30m"",   ""geographic coverage"": ""Global coverage"",   ""source"": """",   ""goal"": [     ""Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts*.""   ],   ""target"": [     ""Target 13. 2.

Advance frameworks consider both water performance in the direct operations as well as the indirect water footprint in order to fully understand how a certain business relates to water use efficiency and the exposure to risk.
