## Scenarios and Interventions Workflow

### User acceptance test

The user should be able to...

- [ ] ...create a new scenario.
- [ ] ...see scenarios already created.
- [ ] ...edit or delete and scenario.
- [ ] ...add one or more interventions to a selected scenario.
- [ ] ...see interventions created for a scenario.
- [ ] ...edit, disable or remove an intervention of a specific scenario.
- [ ] ...select only one scenario at the same time to visualize.

### UX decisions

* When the user clicks on the button to create a new scenario, a new scenario will be created throw API with the name "Untitled" and the user will redirect to the edition scenario page.
* Infinite scroll for the scenarios and intervertion list
* Action buttons should be fixed (filters and buttons)

### Routing

* `/analysis`: list scenarios
* `/analysis?scenario=:id`: there is a scenario selected for visualization
* `/analysis?scenario=edit=:id`: edit a scenario given an id
* `/analysis?scenario=new`: creates a new scenario and redirect to `/analysis?edit_scenario=:id`
* `/analysis?scenario=edit=:id?new_intervention`: edit a scenario and open the form for intervention creation
* `/analysis?scenario=edit=:id&edit_intervention=:id`: edit a scenario and/or an intervention given an id

## Visualizations modes

### User acceptance test

The user should be able to...

- [ ] ...choice how to visualize the data on analysis (map, table or chart). By default is map.
- [ ] ...collapse the sidebar and content to gain more space for the visualization. By default is not collapsed.

### Routing

* `/analysis?mode=map|table|chart`: select the mode of visualization
* `/analysis?collapsed=true`: collapse the sidebar

## Filters

### User acceptance test

The user should be able to ...

 - [ ] ... filter the data used for the visualization by indicator, group by and select a range of years.
 - [ ] ... additionally also can filter by other fields such as material, regions or suppliers (multiple selection).

### UX decisisions

* "All indicators" option is only available for table and chart. In case the user wants to change to the map view and the "all indicators" is selected, we should warn it and select other indicator.

### Data needs

* Indicators: ?? (already asked on Jira)
* Groups: ?? (already asked on Jira)
* Years: ?? (already asked on Jira)
* Materials: from API
* Origins: from API
* Suppliers: from API

### Data format

```json
{
  "indicators": [1, 2, 3], // ids of indicators
  "groupBy": "material", // material, business-unit, region, supplier, location type
  "start_year": 2020,
  "end_year": 2030, // only for map and chart
  "materials": [1, 2, 3], // ids of materials
  "origins": [1, 2, 3], // ids of locations
  "suppliers": [1, 2, 3], // ids of suppliers
}
```

### Routing

* `analysis?filters[field_name]=value`: filters parameters
* `analysis?filters[field_name]=value1,value2`: for multiple choices

## Map

### User acceptance test

The user should be able to...

- [ ] ...visualize the layer defined by the filters on the map
- [ ] ...the layer should be visualized by a choropleth h3 layer
- [ ] ...see the impact of a selected scenario on the map (pending to define)
- [ ] ...see a legend, navigate and change the zoom
- [ ] ...save the status of the map in the URL (viewport and filters)

### Routing

* `/analysis?center=[lat,lng]&zoom=1`: viewport of the map
* `/analysis?filters=`: filters applied (pending to define)
