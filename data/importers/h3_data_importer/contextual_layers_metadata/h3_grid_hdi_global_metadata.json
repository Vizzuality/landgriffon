    "description": "The Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure of human development published by the UNDP. It assesses three dimensions: health, education, and standard of living. For health, it considers life expectancy at birth. Education is evaluated based on years of schooling for adults and expected years of schooling for children. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI combines these dimensions using a geometric mean to calculate a composite index. It provides an annual snapshot of human development for 188 countries worldwide.",
