# Installation

## 1. Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` at the root of the app:

```
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_TOKEN=mapbox-token

```
See on LastPass the complete version.

## 2. Install dependencies

Requirements:

* Node 14.17.0 (NVM compatible)
* Yarn as package manager: `npm i -g yarn`

Run the next command to install all the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Once you installed all the dependencies and packages you will be able to run these commands available in `package.json` by using `yarn dev`, `yarn build` or `yarn start`

```json
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev` - Runs next dev which starts Next.js in development mode
- `build` - Runs next build which builds the application for production usage
- `start` - Runs next start which starts a Next.js production server


## 3. Run the development server

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## 3. Running Storybook

You can also init the Storybook server running the next command:

```bash
yarn storybook:dev
```

A new tab will be opened by default. But you can also open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).
