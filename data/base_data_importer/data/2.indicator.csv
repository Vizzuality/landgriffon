Remote sensing imagery and machine learning algorithms are used to identify forest loss, and the annual rate of deforestation is weighted by commodity production to account for areas where the commodity is grown. The indicator provides insight into the risk of sourcing contributing to deforestation, distinguishing between natural forest loss and loss from plantations. Human land use is factored in by combining crop data, pasture and plantation areas."",""license"": ""CC BY 4.0"",""geographic coverage"": ""Global coverage."",""citation"": [    ""Karra, Kontgis, et al. “Global land use/land cover with Sentinel-2 and deep learning.” IGARSS 2021-2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium.
