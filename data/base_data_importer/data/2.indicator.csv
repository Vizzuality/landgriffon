Alert dates represent the instance of detection, though tree cover loss could have taken place earlier, possibly weeks earlier, due to persistent cloud cover. In this data set, “tree cover” is defined as all vegetation greater than 5 meters in height with greater than 60% canopy cover, and may take the form of natural forests or plantations. “Tree cover loss” indicates the canopy removal of at least half a pixel and can be due to a variety of factors, including mechanical harvesting, fire, disease, or storm damage. As such, “loss” does not equate to deforestation. In Peru, where the alert system was first developed, the authors evaluated the data to have 13.5 percent false positives (loss detected where none occurred), though the majority of those false positives (9.5 percent) occur on the edges of clearings. On edges, the 30 meter Landsat pixels show a mix of forest and other land cover, which makes them prone to error in the system. The rate of false positives drops to 1 percent when only considering high confidence alerts. The data has 33 percent false negatives (undetected loss where it has occurred), though most of these occur in secondary forests—likely because the algorithm was created to capture primary forest loss. The higher rate of false negatives compared to false positives also indicates that the alerts are a conservative estimate of the tree cover loss that is actually occurring. When zoomed out, this data layer displays some degree of inaccuracy because the data points must be collapsed to be visible on a larger scale.

While most existing loss alert products use 250-meter resolution MODIS imagery, these alerts have a 30-meter resolution and thus can detect loss at a much finer spatial scale. The alerts are operational for land areas between 30 degrees north and south.New Landsat 7 and 8 images are downloaded as they are posted online, assessed for cloud cover or poor data quality, and compared to the three previous years of Landsat-derived metrics (including ranks, means, and regressions of red, infrared and shortwave bands, and ranks of NDVI, NBR, and NDWI). The metrics and the latest Landsat image are run through seven decision trees to calculate a median probability of forest disturbance. Pixels with probability >50% are reported as tree cover loss alerts. The entire process is run in Google Earth Engine to ensure reliable updates and scalability. For more information on methodology, see the paper in Environmental Research Letters. Alerts are not classified as high confidence until two or more out of four consecutive observations are labelled as tree cover loss. Alerts are removed from the dataset after four consecutive observations or more than 180 days if they are not classified as high confidence. You can choose to view only high confidence alerts in the menu, though keep in mind that using only high confidence alerts misses the newest detections of tree cover loss."", ""citation"": ""Hansen, M.C., A.

Net flux reflects the total over the model period of 2001-2021, not an annual time series from which a trend can be derived. Thus, values must be divided by 20 to calculate average annual net flux. Uncertainty is higher in gross removals than emissions, driven largely by uncertainty in removal factors for established temperate forests outside the US and Europe. Values are applicable to forest areas (canopy cover >30 percent and >5 m height). See Harris et al. (2021) for further information on the forest definition used in the analysis. Emissions are from stand-replacing disturbances and do not include emissions from forest degradation.

Net carbon flux is calculated by subtracting average annual gross removals from average annual gross emissions in each modeled pixel; negative values are where forests were net sinks of carbon and positive values are where forests were net sources of carbon between 2001 and 2021. Net fluxes are calculated following IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories in each pixel where forests existed in 2000 or were established between 2000 and 2012 according to the Global Forest Change tree cover change data of Hansen et al. (2013). This layer reflects the cumulative net flux during the model period (2001-2020) and must be divided by 19 to obtain average annual net flux; net flux values cannot be assigned to individual years of the model. This net flux layer is part of the forest carbon flux model described in Harris et al. (2021). This paper introduces a geospatial monitoring framework for estimating global forest carbon fluxes which can assist governments and non-government actors with tracking greenhouse gas fluxes from forests and decreasing emissions or increasing removals by forests. All input layers were resampled to a common resolution of 0.00025 x 0.00025 degrees each to match Hansen et al. (2013). Net flux is available for download in two different area units over the model duration: 1) megagrams of CO2e ha-1, and 2) megagrams of CO2e pixel-1. The first is appropriate for visualizing (mapping) net flux because it represent the density of carbon fluxes per hectare. The second is appropriate for calculating the net flux in an area of interest (AOI) because the values of the pixels in the AOI can be summed to obtain the total carbon flux for that area. The values in the latter were calculated by adjusting the net flux per hectare by the size of each pixel, which varies by latitude. When estimating net flux occurring over a defined number of years between 2001 and 2021, divide the provided values by the model duration and then multiply by the number of years in the period of interest."", ""citation"": ""Harris et al.
