We estimate forest carbon loss due to deforestation by combining\ndeforestation extent with maps of vulnerable carbon (Noon et al. 2021) in those same\nareas. Vulnerable carbon, the amount of biomass and soil carbon that would be lost in a\nland use change event, is reported globally for 2010 at a 300m resolution.",
